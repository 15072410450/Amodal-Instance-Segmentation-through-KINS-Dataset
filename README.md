## Introduction
This repository has released the training and test set of KINS. The annotation format follows COCO style. The mask can be decoded by COCOAPI.

And the pytorch implementation of the method in CVPR 2019 paper '[Amodal Instance Segmentation through KINS Dataset](http://jiaya.me/papers/amodel_cvpr19.pdf)' will be released. The codebase is based on [maskrcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark).
