## Introduction
This repository releases the training set of KINS. And the pytorch implementation of the method in CVPR 2019 paper '[Amodal Instance Segmentation through KINS Dataset](http://jiaya.me/papers/amodel_cvpr19.pdf)' will be released. The codebase is based on [pytorch-Detectron](https://github.com/roytseng-tw/Detectron.pytorch).
